## Top Images

As mentioned above you can link some images to your account (discord based authentication) so that you can consult them using the discord [bot](https://ayane.fr/invite), the [website](https://www.waifu.im) or even the API.
You can prompt users their permission to manage and view their favorites so that you can develop your own application including this feature.
