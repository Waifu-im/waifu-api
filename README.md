[Waifu.im](https://waifu.im) was originally created to be an alternative to [waifu.pics](https://waifu.pics), because it didn't match some of my requirements. Bit by bit waifu.im has been improved to an extent that it is now one of the best Waifu APIs. You can compose a gallery of your favorite pictures, and even upload new ones. It is easy to use and well-thought-out so that most of the endpoints have the same json structure. Finally, I would like to thank [JSH32](https://github.com/JSH32) for his precious advice regarding the infrastructure when he did not even know me.

## Top Images

As mentioned above you can link some images to your account (discord based authentication) so that you can consult them using the discord [bot](https://ayane.fr/invite), the [website](https://www.waifu.im) or even the API.
You can prompt users their permission to manage and view their favorites so that you can develop your own application including this feature.
